# My_first_project

Hi. This is my first machine learning project. I wish to add more codes here in future.

In this project, I wish to use the data from the kickstarter projects. The provided data gives me the category, country, currency, the pleded amount (in USD and in the given currency), the deadline for the completion of the project, and the state of the project (whether it is successful or not).

In this project, I have tried to use different classification methods to find out which of the models gives the best accuracy. The method of random forest (classification as this model tries to predict whether the given project will be successful or not) gives me the highest accuracy or about 92%, which seems pretty good. To optimise my code, I have used the Grid search method.

This model tries to predict if your kickstarter project would get funding, and be able to take off!
